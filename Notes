Important points:
- now the mathematica link is in another repository - this is pure c++ code

TODO:

- compute Stress and displacement methods in the bigwhamio class
- tidy up the 3D mesh object
- tidy up the 3DT6 implementation
- code up HLU solve on the C++ side [currently a problem with duplicate ludecomposition at link time - not solved with inline or static]
- modify preconditioner -> put it bigwham instance ?
- re-write google tests for basic operations of the C++ code, leave more intrincate benchmarks and physics verification on the mma side.
  ---> #include <src/elasticity/AssemblyDDM.h> the file does not exist anymore
- the google test package is embedded in the il library. One should take it out and make it available to other parts of the code.

Hmat-Lib:
- mpi of the h-dot product ? in a memory ??
