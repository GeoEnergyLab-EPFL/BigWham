Important points:
- now the mathematica link is in another repository - this is pure c++ code

TODO:

Hmat-Lib:

- remove


- Code up atomic test (single elements test) for all kernels ?

- compute Stress and displacement methods in the bigwhamio class
- tidy up the 3D mesh object
- tidy up the 3DT6 implementation
- code up HLU solve on the C++ side [currently a problem with duplicate ludecomposition at link time - not solved with inline or static]

- re-write google tests for basic operations of the C++ code, leave more intrincate benchmarks and physics verification on the mma side.
  ---> #include <src/elasticity/AssemblyDDM.h> the file does not exist anymore




- OPEN MP

This code uses openMP to parallelize some parts.
If we are using mac OS, now (2019), Clang and Clang++ (*1) doesn't have openMP.
You need to install llvm compiler with openMP. We use Homebrew to get the packages.
Open a terminal and type:

  brew update
  brew install llvm libomp

  You will obtain the following message at the end:
  ___________________________________________________________________
  To use the bundled libc++ please add the following LDFLAGS:
    LDFLAGS="-L/usr/local/opt/llvm/lib -Wl,-rpath,/usr/local/opt/llvm/lib"

  llvm is keg-only, which means it was not symlinked into /usr/local,
  because macOS already provides this software and installing another version in
  parallel can cause all kinds of trouble.

  If you need to have llvm first in your PATH run:
    echo 'export PATH="/usr/local/opt/llvm/bin:$PATH"' >> ~/.bash_profile

  For compilers to find llvm you may need to set:
    export LDFLAGS="-L/usr/local/opt/llvm/lib"
    export CPPFLAGS="-I/usr/local/opt/llvm/include"

  ___________________________________________________________________
LDFLAGS=-L/usr/local/opt/llvm/lib -Wl,CPPFLAGS=-I/usr/local/opt/llvm/include
So, you need to add those lines at the end of your .bash_profile (*2)

 LDFLAGS="-L/usr/local/opt/llvm/lib"
 CPPFLAGS="-I/usr/local/opt/llvm/include"
 PATH="/usr/local/opt/llvm/bin:$PATH"

After your .bash_profile has been modified you need to source it.
Type in your terminal:

 source .bash_profile


(*1) Usually Clang and Clang++ are located in /usr/bin/
(*2) To locate your .bash_profile open a terminal and type:
      cd
      ls -la
